In this C++ project, I implemented different statistical functions to calculate Phi value and Psi value in order to retrieve the frequency of every character, so that I can decipher the ciphertext.
<br/>Detailed explanation is in ADFGVX_report.pdf.
</br>With this project, I successfully cracked the ciphertext and got the plaintext.
